press up or down on the navswitch if the Funkit is held horizontally (i.e. east or
west press on the navswitch).

When both players have their options ready, one user must push down on the navswitch
and the two player's inputs are compared with each other to determine a winner. The

Dependent on the outcome, the player is prompted with either: "WIN", "DRAW" or "LOSS. This
is then followed up with the player's current score.

The game is played until one of the players' score reaches 3 points. Once this occurs, the player
is prompted with either: "CONGRATS, YOU WON!" or "HARD LUCK, YOU LOST".

After the game is ended, Rock Paper Scissors 11 restarts again at the welcoming screen, and 
players can choose to play again if they wish by pressing down on the navswitch and restarting
the process.
